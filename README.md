Since the vasprun.xml output files, coming out of electronic density of states calculations, are quite heavy, they are not directly available in this repository. You can download them from this zipped <a href="https://indianinstituteofscience-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/derejebekele_iisc_ac_in/ESzL4z7xyJ9Eq8Q70GoaH0kBGgVRokZ4IDPih7LyY-VhSg?e=caRfCU">OneDrive link</a>. Please do contact drop an email to the authors of the manuscript in case you are unable to access the OneDrive link or have issues with downloading the file.
